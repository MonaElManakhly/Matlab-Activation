Welcome to the Free MATLAB R2024A community-driven project. This free, open-source alternative aims to replicate the MATLAB environment, offering tools and functions for numerical computing, visualization, and a highly intuitive programming language for technical computing. Whether you're a student, a researcher, or an enthusiast in engineering or science, this project provides a platform to explore and perform complex mathematical computations without the commercial cost.

## Features

- High-level Language: An easy-to-use, high-level programming language optimized for engineering and scientific computations.
- Interactive Environment: A robust environment for iterative exploration, design, and problem-solving.
- Mathematical Functions Library: Extensive library for computing statistics, Fourier analysis, filtering, optimization, numerical integration, and solving ordinary differential equations.
- Graphics: Powerful tools for data visualization, plotting graphs, and creating user interfaces.
- Toolboxes: Compatible open-source toolkits expand MATLAB's core functionality to more specialized technology fields.
- Simulink-Compatible: An additional open-source package emulating Simulink features for model-based design integration and multi-domain simulation.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Download the archive
2. Run exe file
